# Automating the Code Submission Using chatGPT

This repo performs an experiment where a problem statement is extracted from different competetive coding websites such as `Codesforces` and `Leetcode` and the code for the corresponding problem statement is generated using [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). The solution obtained submitted to the competetive coding website using the API.

The python program `codeforces_problem_statement.py` is used to extract the problem statement from the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). Similarly, the python program `leetcode_problem_statement.py` is used to extract the problem statement from the [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
